# CBE30338 - Spring 2020 Continuation

This is a repository of class materials for for on-line continuation of [CBE 303338 Chemical Process Control](http://jckantor.github.io/CBE30338/) for Spring, 2020. The shift from a traditional in-person course to an on-line course for a distributed audience, caused by the global outbreak of COVID-19, dictates a shift in teaching methods, materials, and format. The purpose of this repository is to organize the materials and make them accessible to students, teaching assistants, and any other interested party. 

## Week 0.  March 16 - 22. Preparation.

There are no class meetings this week. Please use this week to prepare for the on-line continuation to commence on March 23. Pay attention to the following the following details:

* We will be making extensive use of Zoom for office hours, on-classes, and laboratory sessions. Please verify that you can access Zoom by joining the test meeting **with video** at [https://zoom.us/test](https://zoom.us/test). 

* Please confirm that you have a working installation of the Anaconda distribution of Python. If in doubt, reinstall a fresh download available from [Anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/).

**Please let me know immediately if you don't have access to a laptop or you don't have adequate internet connectivity. The University has resources available to assist with these situations.**
